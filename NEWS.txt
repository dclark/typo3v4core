CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS in TYPO3 3.8.1
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

Enhancements
=============

	* New property value: $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['displayErrors']=2 will only enable the display_errors PHP directive if the devIPmask matches the current clients IP address. (Michael Stucki)

Fixes
======

	* The "addQueryString" property for typolinks is finally working (Michael Stucki)
	* The new parameter "config.disableImgBorderAttr" will finally do what the name says (Rupert Germann)
	* "forceReturnPath" did not work in t3lib_htmlmail because the variable was named wrong (Michael Stucki)
	* GEMNU Rollover did not work in Opera (Martin Kutschker)
	* Fixed broken image-alignment in Mozilla browsers (Martin Kutschker)
	* Fixed database problems with showpic.php (Bernhard Kraft)

Compatibility
==============

	* GMENU_LAYERS and TMENU_LAYERS and image rollovers now work with Opera browsers (Martin Kutschker)

Security
=========

	* !!! config.baseURL=1 will no longer work. baseURL needs to be set to a string value. See upcoming security report for more information. (Michael Stucki)
	* A cross-site scripting issue in showpic.php was fixed (Martin Klaus)
	* Shift-reload no longer works if there is no be_user (Kasper Skårhøj)
	* Install Tool: When editing a file (e.g. localconf.php), the backup was renamed to filename.php~ (could be viewed in clear-text). This has been fixed, however you are adviced to remove/rename such files if you find them on your server. (Lars Houmark / Michael Stucki)
	* A debug script exposed system information provided by phpinfo(). For details, see http://typo3.org /teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-20050725-1/ (Michael Stucki)
	* The encryptionKey auto-generation in the Install Tool did not work correctly: The 32 first characters were always the same. Very theoretical risk. (Jochen Weiland)
